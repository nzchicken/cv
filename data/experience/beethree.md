Nextview (formerly Beethree) was my first job in The Netherlands. Nextview is a 
Salesforce consultancy, where I worked on varying clients, including Guidion for 
the better part of 8 months.

I participated in the full spectrum of consultancy activities from presales 
through to development and support. I was relied on for my depth and knowledge 
of Salesforce, along with my systems architecture knowledge to bring quality 
implementations for the clients I worked on.

My approach to requirements was to always ask for the "Why" to ensure I was 
building the right thing that would actually solve the business problem. I
engaged with decision makers to ensure that we were working together.

This is where I started heavily using and implementing SFDX, along with CI/CD to
ensure that our team was as productive as possible.
